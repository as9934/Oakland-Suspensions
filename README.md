# Good Intentions, Uncertain Results: An examination of Oakland Unified School District’s suspension rates, racial disparities.


There is a long-documented history of racial discrimination in school discipline. Black kids and in particular Black boys are suspended at much higher rates than their White classmates. This disparity not only removes children from instructional time it also has numerous other pernicious effects including lower college attendance and academic performance. In fact, one study from University of Kentucky researchers concluded that a fifth of the Black-White achievement gap could be attributed to suspension disparities.


Many would suspect that Oakland Unified School District would buck this trend. To address this issue, the OUSD has invested millions of dollars on several programs - they created an office catering just to Black male achievement, implemented restorative justice and positive behavior intervention programs and banned suspensions for “willful defiance”. 

But despite historic efforts and millions of dollars invested, the suspension rate and racial disparity in suspensions has stayed basically flat in the past five school years. 

This project visualizes the disparity between suspensions of White and Black children in Oakland over a five school year period, from 2015 to 2020. 

Some of the HTML and Javascript was taken from Mapbox's tutorial project. The Python and SQL was pretty much all me.
